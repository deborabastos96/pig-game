# Pig Game

This folder contains the archives from the lessons on creating the Pig Game project. It is a simple game created using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
The goal is to reach one hundred (100) points before the other player. However, if you roll a one on the dice, your turn will be skipped, and you will lose all points for that round. Have fun!
